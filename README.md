# Restaurant-Reservation-System

###  Introduction

Restaurant reservation systems are becoming increasingly advanced and popular. If youâ€™re
considering installing a reservation system for your restaurant there are a number of factors to
consider when selecting a system and provider.
A restaurant reservation system should provide you with the tools to plan and run your restaurant
effectively and manage your tables. Efficient table management means that a restaurant can maximize
the potential of their dining room and this in change should increase profits

### Problem and Solution

The aim is to solve a critical problem both for restaurants and for restaurant-goers.
All restaurants, large and small, have problems with uneven client turnover. If there is a large
group assume 10 to 15 people it gets difficult to find a table without a reservation. It also gets
unmanageable for the restaurant manager to accumulate them without any reservation. In our
reservation system, we can assign tables to the guests and make sure the table is ready with a
fit number of seats and cutlery.
Knowing how many people are going to be in a restaurant at a given time leads to greater
efficiency and fewer headaches for restaurant owners and managers. Plus, guests appreciate
the opportunity to book a cozy table in advance and not worry about availability.
